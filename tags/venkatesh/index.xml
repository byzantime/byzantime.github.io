      <description>&lt;p&gt;This gem turned up in the Ribbonfarm post &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/01/31/stone-soup-for-the-capitalists-soul/&#34;&gt;Stone-Soup for the Capitalistâ€™s Soul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your rights to your wealth do not extend beyond your understanding of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are fair game for hustlers who understand your wealth better than you do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of the state is to limit the violence with which you can be hustled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are poor you have the right to hustle the rich within certain limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a take on the old stone-soup fable in which a hungry soldier returning from war asks an old woman for food and is denied.  He then tells her he can make a magnificent soup using only a stone and hot water.  The old woman is curious and asks him to show her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between tastes, he tells the woman the soup is coming along nicely; &amp;ldquo;however it would be even better if only they had a little &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;insert ingredient&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;ldquo;.  In this way he persuades her to part with more ingredients until he has prepared a great meal for them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the soldier leaves and the old woman realises it&amp;rsquo;s just a normal stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venkatesh doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you what to do with his writing.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably best left as an exercise for the reader.  Gotta have some skin in the game after all.&lt;/p&gt;

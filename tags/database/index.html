		<time>Mar 16, 2017</time>
		<div>
			Having made countless cups of AeroPress&rsquo;d coffee (mostly at work), I&rsquo;ve finally arrived at the perfect cuppa.
 Boil the jug. Yup, boil. You&rsquo;ll see why in a moment. Pour boiling water into your coffee cup. If you take milk in your coffee leave room for milk. Otherwise fill it up. Grind coffee / put ground coffee in an inverted AeroPress. Fill AeroPress with hot water from cup. Your cup is now hot and the water has cooled to the perfect temperature.

		<time>Mar 13, 2017</time>
		<div>
			So! I have a new project underway, CourseMonger.com.
Unlike many solutions, this one started with a problem. My partner teaches parenting courses, each comprised of multiple workshops. Each workshop can be at a different price and vary in number of places available. Any prospective system would also need to provide a reservation system whereby a place is reserved for say, 8 minutes while a student completes her booking.
Eventbrite provides registration-locking, but the Eventbrite model is based on events, many people at a specific location and time at perhaps a few different pricepoints (tickets).

		<time>Jun 5, 2016</time>
		<div>
			I once had a scenario where one business could be managed by multiple users, and each user could manage multiple businesses. To further complicate matters, only one user could be the Administrator of a business, which should ideally also be represented by the relationship.
Finding out how to represent that relationship was tricky as I couldn&rsquo;t find it in the SQLAlchemy docs, and StackOverflow was a mixed bag. This is what I pieced together:

		<time>May 29, 2016</time>
		<div>
			This gem turned up in the Ribbonfarm post Stone-Soup for the Capitalist’s Soul:
 Your rights to your wealth do not extend beyond your understanding of it. You are fair game for hustlers who understand your wealth better than you do. The role of the state is to limit the violence with which you can be hustled. If you are poor you have the right to hustle the rich within certain limits.

		<time>Feb 27, 2016</time>
		<div>
			Installing Cordova wasn&rsquo;t straightforward, so I wrote up what worked for me.
First follow the instructions here to install Nodejs and create a symlink because it gets installed as nodejs rather than node.
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node  NPM is thankfully in the debian repos:
sudo apt-get install npm sudo apt-get install -y build-essential  Install Cordova using NPM and create your first project:
sudo npm install -g cordova cordova create MyProject cd MyProject platform add browser platform add android  The cordova run browser command requires google-chrome so I installed chromium then symlinked google-chrome to it (you can skip this step if you use Chrome):

		<time>Nov 12, 2014</time>
		<div>
			Some time mid-2013 I was reading through rpietila&rsquo;s posts on the bitcointalk.org forums and came across the theory that you could &ldquo;call the top&rdquo; of a bubble simply by selling if the price doubles in 7 days.
Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s got 4.7k-odd posts now, so the exact post has eluded me so far.
While the old trope &ldquo;past performance doesn&rsquo;t indicate future results&rdquo; always applies, there&rsquo;s no harm in being prepared to take advantage of an identified pattern should it manifest again.

		<time>Nov 12, 2014</time>
		<div>
			Hey! Welcome to my new blog.
So, when it came to setting up a blog again, I didn&rsquo;t want to go the old route to Livejournal / Blogger / Tumblr. Too much Y2K, Google, and teenage girl angst, respectively. Svbtle &amp; Ghost cost money, and Medium&rsquo;s focus is on the platform, not you. That&rsquo;s when I remembered Github pages allows you to setup a free static site.
First create a new Github pages repo called username.

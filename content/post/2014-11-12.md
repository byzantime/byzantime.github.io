Hey! Welcome to my new blog.

So, when it came to setting up a blog again, I didn't want to go the old route to Livejournal / Blogger / Tumblr.  Too much Y2K, Google, and teenage girl angst, respectively.
Svbtle & Ghost cost money, and Medium's focus is on the platform, not you.  That's when I remembered Github pages allows you to setup a free static site.

First create a [new Github pages repo](https://github.com/new) called *username*.github.io, where *username* is your Github username.
Create a new folder locally to store the site files (I like to keep website files tidy in ```/var/www/```):

{{< highlight bash >}}
mkdir /var/www/username.github.io
cd /var/www/username.github.io
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
{{< /highlight >}}

To save time on building a site, I first tried using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but found the instructions unclear and the setup seemed needlessly complex.  Apart from that, why is it so difficult to install anything Node related on Debian (though a friend has the same issue on Fedora, so maybe it's a Node thing)?

Then I found [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), which allows you to write content using markdown and renders site templates into HTML using [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).  It's also much easier to install and get running!

{{< highlight bash >}}
pip install pelican
{{< /highlight >}}

Site content goes in a ```content/``` folder inside the pelican install directory, and individual pages start with simple metadata:

{{< highlight text >}}
Title: My super title

Tags: pelican, publishing
Slug: my-super-post
Authors: Alexis Metaireau, Conan Doyle
Summary: Short version for index and feeds

This is the content of my super blog post.
{{< /highlight >}}

To preview the site locally, run a Python web server, then check [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

{{< highlight bash >}}
cd output
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
{{< /highlight >}}

To publish your content live, back in the main site directory run the following commands:

{{< highlight bash >}}
pelican
cd output
git add --all
git commit -m "my first commit"
git push
{{< /highlight >}}

Of course, there's lots of other things you can do, like changing or customising the default theme.  [Read the docs here](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/) (wish more projects used [read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/)!

                <p>This gem turned up in the Ribbonfarm post <em><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/01/31/stone-soup-for-the-capitalists-soul/">Stone-Soup for the Capitalistâ€™s Soul</a></em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your rights to your wealth do not extend beyond your understanding of it.</li>
<li>You are fair game for hustlers who understand your wealth better than you do.</li>
<li>The role of the state is to limit the violence with which you can be hustled.</li>
<li>If you are poor you have the right to hustle the rich within certain limits.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s a take on the old stone-soup fable in which a hungry soldier returning from war asks an old woman for food and is denied.  He then tells her he can make a magnificent soup using only a stone and hot water.  The old woman is curious and asks him to show her.</p>

<p>Between tastes, he tells the woman the soup is coming along nicely; &ldquo;however it would be even better if only they had a little &lt;<em>insert ingredient</em>&gt;&ldquo;.  In this way he persuades her to part with more ingredients until he has prepared a great meal for them both.</p>

<p>Ultimately the soldier leaves and the old woman realises it&rsquo;s just a normal stone.</p>

<p>Venkatesh doesn&rsquo;t tell you what to do with his writing.  It&rsquo;s probably best left as an exercise for the reader.  Gotta have some skin in the game after all.</p>
